Jara Zend Framework Application
===============================
 A Zend Framework starter application. This is essentially a modified version of the Zend Studio project structure with the following variations/additions:

 -- Added a test helper to the tests folder.   
 -- Added a static route plugin for handling static site pages. 
 
Usage
==========
 -- Download and unzip Jara Base.
 -- Copy to the library files to the root of your application.
 -- Set up your virtual host and make the 'public' folder the web root. 
 -- Enjoy!
 
Adding static pages
===================
Jara Base already includes an about page with a corresponding view and this page is accessed with 'http://www.example.com/about' rather than 'http://www.example.com/index/about'.

To add a static page, add an action to the 'Index' controller of the 'Default' module. Add a corresponding view and the page will be available at 'http://www.example.com/:action'.
Static routes with the same name as your controller actions are created by default. 
To disable static routes, comment out (or delete) the static routes line in the plugins section of the application config file (application.ini).
