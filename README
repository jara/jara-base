Jara Zend Framework Application
===============================
 A Zend Framework starter application. This is essentially a modified version of the Zend Studio project structure with the following variations/additions:

 -- Defined an APP_ROOT constant. 
 -- Defined an APP_ENV constant.  
 -- Added include paths dynamically.  
 -- Set front controller directories dynamically. 
 -- Added a test helper to the tests folder.  
 -- Dynamically added tests to the AllTests suite.
 -- Changed the folder structure for the tests. 
 -- Added a 'page' route for handling static site pages. 
 
Usage
==========
 -- Download and unzip Jara Base.
 -- Copy to the library files to the root of your application.
 -- Make sure the Zend library files are in the application include path.
 -- Set up your virtual host and make the 'public' folder the web root. 
 -- Enjoy!
 
Adding static pages
===================
Jara Base already includes an about page with a corresponding view and this page is accessed with 'http://www.example.com/about' rather than 'http://www.example.com/index/about'.

To add a static page, add an action to the 'Index' controller of the 'Default' module. Add a corresponding view and the page will be available at 'http://www.example.com/:action'.
